# coffee-and-wifi
Flask app that showcases informations about  a collection of cafes as well as ratings on power socket availability, wifi speed and coffee quality.

One of the goals of making this app was to review/practice the use of Flask-WTF, Flask-Bootstrap, Bootstrap classes and Jinja template inheritance.

This app is able to serve different HTMl files : a homepage, a page dsiplaying all the cafes we list and "secret" page containing 
a form that allows the admin to add a new cafe to the list.

Homepage:

Form:

The page displaying all the cafes, shows their name, location and information regarding the quality of the Wifi, the coffee and the level
of availability for power sockets. The user can therefore at a glance see which are the best cafe in order to sit down and work or 
sit down and relax.

The data about the cafes is kept into a .csv file and adding a new cafe listing via the form (on the "/add" route) will append a new line 
of data into the .csv file.

The form is rendered thanks to the class FlaskForm (from the flask_wtf package) and the quick_form method from Flask-Bootstrap.
The data from the form can then be tapped into our server by using the syntax "form_instance_name.field_name.data".

Once the data is extracted from the form, we then write it into the .csv file as a long string with comma-separated values.

We are able to add Bootstrap into our HTML files' styling and even add a bit of our own styling thanks to bootstrap blocks and super blocks.

The main challenge for me during this project was essentially rendering the different cafes listings in the "cafes.html" file.
But I was able to tackle it by hardcoding the first row of my Bootstrap table (the row containing the columns' headers) with the 
values of the first row of the .csv file and then looping across only the rest of the rows of the .csv file (thanks to list slicing as the rows
of the .csv are themselves items of a list and each element separated by a comma is also an item in list aka a single row).

It took a bit of thinking, but I am glad overcame this in such short time.

To run this code, simply run the "main.py" file, this will run the Flask app on a local port and a link should generated by the IDE (in my case, Pycharm).
Make sure the static, templates, requirements and .csv file are in the same directory as the "main.py" file.
